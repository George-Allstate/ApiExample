Ages range from 20 somethings through to 60 somethings \u2013 whoever you are there will be like-minded folk you are sure to find something in common with. <br> </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Our events include coffee and chat, restaurant meals, films, sporting activities, walks, days out, lively evenings in bars, dancing, live gigs, theatre shows, outdoor pursuits, regular bespoke events and tours and other suggestions that ANY member has. </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Why is it so important to be social? More people live alone now than at any other time in history. In the UK some 29% of all households contain just a single occupant (2013 Census). People living alone are far more likely to want to get out and about and enjoy&nbsp;social interaction. This is exactly what we offer. <br> <br> Most of our events are very loosely structured. Event Hosts come up with something they enjoy doing and invite others in the group to join&nbsp;in. If you are new, let Event Hosts know, and they&nbsp;will introduce you to other Members, and, at each event, active members will make you welcome and help you to feel part of the group.&nbsp;</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span>Our group is not for profit, so&nbsp;there are no additional costs to attend events (apart from venue admission&nbsp;fees or&nbsp;charges for meals, etc.),&nbsp;but we would appreciate it if you would make a donation of Â£5 to support the group and cover running costs - to make a donation just follow the link at \"Donations\". <br> <br></span><span><strong>Belfast Social Events Group</strong> - the name says it all! Life is a journey so why not make the journey fun and exciting? Social events will get you out of the house, help you to make new friends, go to new places, laugh, dance, and chill out. We are all social beings, and Belfast is the place to join in social events and find good company, good craic, and good times!</span></em></p>\n<p><em><strong><span>Now you can follow us on Twitter:&nbsp; @ BelfastEvent <br>&nbsp; <br> </span></strong></em></p>",
